# IRE1 cluster paper
A version of my ongoing project, Cluster-analysis, dedicated specifically to the analysis for
our upcoming paper on the dynamics of IRE1 clusters.

Most of the analysis code is written in Python, but the project also includes short ImageJ scripts
and CellProfiler pipelines to handle the first few steps of image processing.
